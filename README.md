- 👋 Hi, I’m @strictlyliftin
- 👀 I’m interested in code models related to carbon emissions calculation and graph making with Python or any other input platform.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about coding particularly with Python in order to facilitate the classification and graph design of a bunch of data on carbon emissions and energy consumption.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to the above-mentioned area.
